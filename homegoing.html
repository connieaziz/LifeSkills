<h1><strong><i>ROLE OF WOMEN IN HOME GOING</i></strong></h1>
	<p>
		The role of a woman in the book setting is marriage and childbearing.We can depict this from both chapter one and two.In Effia,Abeeku refused to marry her because she could not bear children;she was not sexually mature because she had not recieved her blood.When Effia became pregnant,James was happy that she could give him a child.We can also see that a woman's place is in the kitchen.When Effia asks Fiifi what they discussed in the meeting she is told that it was men's business;which was slave trade.In Essie,we see that women captured are made to do house chores.<b></b><img src="home going/mum.jpg"width="300",height="50">
	</p>

	<p>
		The future of women is controlled by the men around.For Effia to be married Coobe had to be the final decision maker.Effia could not even question the action of her husband.Even he touched her with the stench from the dungeons.<b></b>
	</p>

	<p>
	Women experience violence.Baaba beats Effia for little or no mistake.Baaba is beaten by her husband also.The big man beats up a slave for not learning her chores quickly.<b></b>

<h1><strong><i>ROLE OF WOMEN IN MODERN SOCIETY</i></strong></h1>
	<p>
		Modern woman is educated and given equal opportunities.They recieve support from both women and men.We find that women in modern society can freely express themselves in any provided space and also compete with men.<b></b>
	</p>

	<p>
		Modern women has discarded poor traditions hindering them from being independent and remarkable.Example FGM,a cultural practise that restricted women from getting married at a tender age hence restricting them from continuing with their education.Women have come out strongly to oppose such cultural practises.<b></b>
