<h1><strong><i>Role of Police in Born A Crime</i></strong></h1>
	<p>
		Some of the police were to go around peeking through windows to see if they could catch anyone
breaking the law. If an interracial couple got caught, they would kick down the door, drag the people
out, beat them and arrest them. But they would only do that to the black person. The police would
always favor the white person and let them go scot-free while the African would pay the
price.<br></br>

Trevor describes South Africa as a police state. He defined it by saying that in the state, everyone thinks
everyone else is the police.The police had recruited some people, in this case he specified that it was
black people, who were acting as spies to aid the police in catching the law breakers.
He goes on to say that even when they were walking in the street with his mother, she would have to
drop him as soon as the police came because they lived in an area that was highly populated by
Europeans and they wouldn&#39;t have believed that she was his mother.<br></br>
In the white areas you rarely saw the police and if you did it was officer friendly while in Soweto the
police were an occupying army. They were militarized. Someone was always marching or protesting
somewhere and had to be suppressed.<br></br>

Trevor says he&#39;d hear gunshots, screams and tear gas being fired
in the air. The police would even take the wrong-color kids in the wrong color area; If you
were black in a white people area, you were taken, and vice-versa.

<h1><strong><i>Relation to Police in Kenya</i></strong></h1>
In Kenya, many times we see the police going after
protesters in a violent manner. They are always heavily armed to suppress the protesters and more often,Gunshots and
tear gas are always fired in the air to control the crowd but instead it cultivates hate
and anger between the people and the crowd.<br></br>
The police in Kenya are friendly with the citizens and not many cases of arrests
because of one&#39;s race have been reported.<br></br>
In the slums like Kibera,you will often find the police are heavily armed and are always on watch
especially during times like the general elections but in the suburbs you rarely find the police harassing
people for no reason.
